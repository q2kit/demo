# DEMO
The "DEMO" program is a convenient tool that enables users to make their websites accessible from the internet, even though the websites are running on their local machines.

# Usage
### Step 1: Create a project
- Visit the website https://ezdemo.org.
- Sign in or create an account if you haven't already.
- After logging in, navigate to the project creation section. This may be labeled as "Create Project" or similar.
- Fill in the required information for your project, such as the project name and domain (if applicable).
- After the project is created successfully, you'll be provided with a secret key. Copy this secret key as you'll need it for the next step.

### Step 2: Run the DEMO program
- Download the DEMO program from the releases section of the repository.
- Once downloaded, unzip the CLI package and install it on your computer.
- Open a terminal or command prompt window. (You can add a path to the environment variables to run the program from any directory)
